        <h2>User Involvement and Safety in Design</h2>

        <p>
          A key lesson in early HCI is that interface decisions directly affect
          user safety and performance. In safety-critical systems, such as
          medical devices, even a small input mistake can lead to serious
          consequences.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consulting real users helps designers understand how people actually
          interact with systems. Interfaces built without user feedback may look
          correct but behave unpredictably during real use.

        <h2>Iterative Design and Prototyping</h2>

        <p>
          Good interface design is rarely perfect on the first attempt.
          Iterative design encourages repeated testing, feedback, and refinement
          so problems are discovered early.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prototypes and mock-ups allow designers to experiment with ideas
          quickly and safely. This reduces development risk and leads to more
          usable final systems.

        <h2>Visual Perception and Context</h2>

        <p>
          Human perception is powerful but influenced by surrounding context.
          Visual illusions demonstrate how the brain interprets shapes based on
          learned expectations rather than pure measurement.
        </p>

        <p>
          Designers must be aware that layout, contrast, and visual framing can
          unintentionally mislead users or create confusion.

        <h2>Memory Limits and Information Organization</h2>

        <p>
          Human short-term memory can hold only a limited amount of information
          at once. Interfaces that overwhelm users with unstructured data
          increase cognitive load.
        </p>

        <p>
          Grouping information into meaningful chunks supports understanding,
          recall, and smoother interaction.
