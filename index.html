        <h2>Assignment Purpose</h2>

        <p>
          Group members are <strong>Sarim Ul Haq & Khubaib Ahmed</strong>, and
          this website represents my Week 05 coursework for CS-555
          Human–Computer Interaction. The focus of this assignment is to
          demonstrate structured, semantic HTML while presenting important HCI
          concepts in a clear and organized way.
        </p>

        <p>
          The design intentionally avoids complex styling so the emphasis
          remains on accessibility, content hierarchy, and meaningful document
          structure.
        </p>

        <h2>Understanding Human–Computer Interaction</h2>

        <p>
          Human–Computer Interaction studies how people interact with digital
          systems and how those systems can be designed to support human goals.
          Effective HCI requires attention to usability, cognitive limits, and
          the real-world tasks users are trying to accomplish.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rather than focusing only on technology, HCI considers the broader
          context of human behavior, collaboration, and decision-making.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Cognitive Considerations in Interface Design</h2>

        <p>
          Interface design must account for how people process and remember
          information. Users perform better when content is grouped logically
          and presented in manageable portions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Organizing information into meaningful sections reduces mental effort
          and helps users navigate complex systems more efficiently.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Movement and Interaction Efficiency</h2>

        <p>
          Physical interaction with an interface should feel natural and
          efficient. Controls that are easy to reach and clearly distinguishable
          support faster and more confident user actions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Designing for efficient movement improves both performance and user
          satisfaction.
        </p>

        <h2>Course Reference</h2>

        <p>
          Concepts discussed in this assignment are grounded in the course
          textbook: Dix, Finlay, Abowd, and Beale —
          <em>Human–Computer Interaction</em>.
